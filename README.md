# independent-study

Repository of ongoing work in Comp Sci Independent Study class. Current objective is to use reinforcement learning to train a program to play a small game.

## Progress:
- created "Flappy Ball" game, located at game.py
- created script that builds multi-layer perceptron neural networks (linearly layered NN) with a variety of parameters (number of neurons at nth layer, activation functions, etc.)
- created a script to capture gameplay frames as arrays of ones and zeroes and save the frames to the disk
